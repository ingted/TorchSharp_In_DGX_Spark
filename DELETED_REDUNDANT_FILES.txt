The following files/directories were removed because they are redundant in the nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3 environment. This image already provides the necessary PyTorch (LibTorch) and CUDA libraries.

Removed items:
4.2G	TorchSharp/libtorch-x64
1.1G	TorchSharp/libtorch-arm64
6.6G	TorchSharp/bin/obj

Cleanup complete.
Aggressive cleanup: Removed all .so files except libLibTorchSharp.so from Native directory.
Final cleanup: Preserved only our built TorchSharp.dll and libLibTorchSharp.so.
Deep cleanup: Removed .git and non-essential build artifacts.
